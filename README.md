Code&Co is a website about programming challenges which have professional possibility. The page has two types of users: programmers and companies.

A programmer is able to do programming challenges and he/she has a historial where he/she is able to see his/her done challenges.

On the other hand, a company is able to create challenges about a programming language (at the moment, Python is just working) and it can manage them.
